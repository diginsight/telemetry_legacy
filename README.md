# INTRODUCTION 
__Common.Diagnostics__ is a .Net package that provides a readable __application execution flow__ to __.Net Log providers__ such as __Log4Net, Serilog or Application Insights, Console, EventLog and Debug__ __.Net Log providers__.<br>

Also, __Common.Diagnostics__ publishes application flow structure and metrics to __Azure Monitor__ and __Grafana__ by means of __OpenTelemetry__.<br>

This makes the application flow fully observable, __still without compromises on performance__.<br>

> __diginsight v3 is now available__ at the following repo: [https://github.com/diginsight/telemetry](https://github.com/diginsight/telemetry)<br>
> Features such as old frameworks support (eg. .Net Framework 4.5+) or observability for startup and static sections may still have limited support on Diginsight v3.<br>
> In these cases the developer may decide to keep the old model from this repository.<br>
> Diginsight v2 will not be discontinued until feature parity is reached.<br>
> Documentation about v2 packages is still available here [Diginsight v2 documentation](<docs/articles/v2/README.md>).<br>


# APPLICATION OBSERVABILITY CONCEPTS 
__Application observability__ is about aggregating, correlating and analyzing the following key elements:<br>
-  __Logs__ with application execution details and data.
-  __The requests and operations structure__ (sometimes also referred as __Activity, Traces or Spans__) with the structure of application calls, related to an event or exception condition.
-  __Metrics__: numeric values (such as latencies, payload sizes, frequencies) that can be aggregated and correlated with the operations structure and the logs.

The image below shows examples about the __3 observability elements__ on Azure Monitor Performance Management (APM) Tools:<br><br>
![Alt text](<01. Opentelemetry elements.jpg>)
<!-- /images/other/ -->


Common.Diagnostics __MakesÂ observability easy__ as:
- it __integrates the 3 observability elements__ (Log, Traces, Metrics) into high performance __text-based streams__.<br>
In particular, traditional File log, Console log or Azure Streaming Console log can be integrated with the full application execution flow.<br>
- it __publishes the 3 observability elements__ to OpenTelemetry and allowing application analysis by means of remote APM tools such as __Azure Monitor__ and __Grafana__.

# GETTING STARTED

Start and completion of __code sections__ are gathered by means of `using statements` that create `Method or Named scopes`.<br>
Traces are written to __standard .Net log providers__ so that applications can keep using their diagnostics system and standard logs are integrated into the execution flow gathered by __Common.Diagnostics__.<br>

Common.Diagnostics is supported by __any .Net Framework version__ supporting .Net Standard 2.0, __any .Net Log provider__.<br><br>
Examples are provided for __.NetCore 3.1+ and .Net Framework 4.6.2+ (including  .Net Framework 6.0)__ and __Blazor WebAssembly__.<br>
Examples show sending telemetry to  __Log4Net, Serilog or Application Insights, Console, EventLog and Debug__ __DotNet Log providers__.<br>
<br>

Steps to use Common.Diagnostics:
1.	Add a package reference to the package __Common.Diagnostics.1.0.\*.\*.nupkg__
![Alt text](<01. Common.Diagnostics package.png>)

2.	Add log providers in the __ConfigureLogging()__ callback and __InitTraceLogger()__ methods
	```c#
	.ConfigureLogging((context, loggingBuilder) =>
	{
		loggingBuilder.ClearProviders();

		var options = new Log4NetProviderOptions();
		options.Log4NetConfigFileName = "log4net.config";
		var log4NetProvider = new Log4NetProvider(options);
		loggingBuilder.AddDiginsightFormatted(log4NetProvider, configuration);

		var telemetryConfiguration = new TelemetryConfiguration(appInsightKey);
		var appinsightOptions = new ApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions();
		var tco = Options.Create<TelemetryConfiguration>(telemetryConfiguration);
		var aio = Options.Create<ApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions>(appinsightOptions);
		loggingBuilder.AddDiginsightFormatted(new ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider(tco, aio), configuration);

		loggingBuilder.AddFilter<ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("", LogLevel.Debug);
	}).Build();

	Host.InitTraceLogger();
	```
	in the previous section __standard log4net provider__ and __standard ApplicationInsight provider__ are configured to receive the execution flow, according to __standard .net logging configuration__.

3.	Add telemetry to your code with __BeginMethodScope(), BeginNamedScope()__ and __ILogger Statements__:
	```c#
	- using var scope = _logger.BeginMethodScope(); // defines a method scope by means of an ILogger instance (class type is taken by the ILogger instance)
	- using var scope = _logger.BeginNamedScope("scopeName"); // defines a named scope within a method scope (eg. to describe loop code sections or async method callbacks).

	- using var innerScope = _logger.BeginMethodScope(new { configuration = configuration .GetLogString()}); // defines a method scope where method parameters are specified 
	```
	use the __scope variable__ to add trace messages to the method scope or the named scope
	```c#
	// log statements within a scope
	- scope.LogTrace("this is a Trace trace");
	- scope.LogDebug("this is a Debug trace");
	- scope.LogInformation("this is a Information trace");
	- scope.LogWarning("this is a Warning trace");
	- scope.LogError("this is a error trace");
	- scope.LogCritical("this is a critical trace");
	- scope.LogException(ex);
	```
	use __standard ILogger statements__ or __TraceLogger static methods__ to add trace messages to the application flow when a scope variable instance is not available.

	```c#
	// standard Ilogger statements:
	- _logger.LogTrace("this is a Trace trace");
	- _logger.LogDebug("this is a Debug trace");
	- _logger.LogInformation("this is a Information trace");
	- _logger.LogWarning("this is a Warning trace");
	- _logger.LogError("this is a error trace");
	- _logger.LogCritical("this is a critical trace");
	- _logger.LogException(ex);

	// log statements with TraceLogger static methods:
	- TraceLogger.LogTrace("this is a Trace trace");
	- TraceLogger.LogDebug("this is a Debug trace");
	- TraceLogger.LogInformation("this is a Information trace");
	- TraceLogger.LogWarning("this is a Warning trace");
	- TraceLogger.LogError("this is a error trace");
	- TraceLogger.LogCritical("this is a critical trace");
	- TraceLogger.LogException(ex);
	```
	In this case log traces are added to the most inner scope, for the current thread.

# TELEMETRY PROVIDERS

The image below shows an example of diginsight telemetry rendered to a log4net log provider for a wpf smart client application:
![alt text](/images/v2/01.%20log4net%20trace.jpg "Diginsight telemetry to log4net log provider")

Similarly, the image below shows the result of rendering telemetry to the console of a web api on an azure kubernetes services container:
![alt text](/images/v2/01.1%20aks%20console%20trace.jpg "Diginsight telemetry to a web api running on AKS container").

An analogous result can be obtained rendering the application flow on the browser console log of a Blazor WebAssembly application:
![alt text](/images/v2/01.2%20blazor%20console%20trace.jpg "Diginsight telemetry of a Blazor WebAssemply application to the browser console log").

The __relevant information of all these flows__ can be collected into centralized storage such as an __Application Insight__ resource or Azure Log Analytics workspace.

The following image shows the information level traces on an ApplicationInsights trace repository:  
![alt text](/images/v2/01.3%20Diginsight%20Application%20Flow%20to%20ApplicationInsight%20trace.jpg "Diginsight telemetry to Application Insight Trace").

where application exceptions traced with __TraceException()__ can be analized into the Exceptions view:
![alt text](/images/v2/01.4%20Diginsight%20Exceptions%20to%20ApplicationInsight.jpg "Diginsight Exceptions into Application Insight Exceptions view").

# STARTING TELEMETRY

Starting telemetry is a matter of configuring the .Net log providers that are suitable for our application.

```c#
.ConfigureLogging((context, loggingBuilder) =>
{
	loggingBuilder.ClearProviders();

	var options = new Log4NetProviderOptions();
	options.Log4NetConfigFileName = "log4net.config";
	var log4NetProvider = new Log4NetProvider(options);
	loggingBuilder.AddDiginsightFormatted(log4NetProvider, configuration);

	var telemetryConfiguration = new TelemetryConfiguration(appInsightKey);
	var appinsightOptions = new ApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions();
	var tco = Options.Create<TelemetryConfiguration>(telemetryConfiguration);
	var aio = Options.Create<ApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions>(appinsightOptions);
	loggingBuilder.AddDiginsightFormatted(new ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider(tco, aio), configuration);

	loggingBuilder.AddFilter<ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("", LogLevel.Debug);
}).Build();

Host.InitTraceLogger();
```

notice that the provider is added with the statement 
```c#
	loggingBuilder.AddDiginsightFormatted(log4NetProvider, configuration);
```
this adds the `Log4NetProvider` as the inner provider of a diginsight `TraceLoggerFormatProvider`.<br>
`TraceLoggerFormatProvider` role is to receive trace entries, keep track of the nesting level for the current thread and eventually format a string for the inner provider.

The image below shows the `TraceLoggerFormatProvider` receiving trace entries from .net ILogger interfaces and formatting them for an inner provider:
![alt text](/images/v2/01.5%20Diginsight%20TraceLoggerFormatProvider%20with%20nested%20provider.jpg "TraceLoggerFormatProvider with an inner provider receiving traces from .net ILogger interfaces")

from now on it is just a metter of adding Method Scopes, named scopes and Trace statements to your code to get the real application flow.<br>

## Instrumenting a Method Scope or a Named Scope
Just write a `using` statement with extensions methods `BeginMethodScope()` and `BeginNamedScope()` to obtain a method or a named __scope variable__.<br>
You can write traces by means of the __scope variable__ or by means of __standard ILogger statements__ or __TraceLogger static methods__.

![alt text](/images/v2/01.6%20Diginsight%20logging%20statements.jpg "Instrimenting code with diginsight")

For every scope variable, diginsight can keep track of the nesting level for the current thread.
When __writing traces with the scope variable__ traces are written at the scope nesting level.

When __writing traces with the ILogger interface__ or the __static methods__ the trace will be written at the nesting level of the __most inner scope, for the curren thread__.

In this case, the log statement can be in a different method than the one where the scope variable is defined (at a higher nesting level).
To indicate this such traces are __prefixed with an ellipsis (...)__.

The following image shows the result of the preceding section, where prefix ellipses are visible for traces from _logger variable or TraceLogger static methods:
![alt text](/images/v2/01.7%20Diginsight%20logging%20output.jpg "Trace output")

## Tracing method parameters, variables and return values
When calling extensions methods `BeginMethodScope()` and `BeginNamedScope()` the method name is obtained by compiler generated information.<br>
You can __provide method parameters__ to the application flow by means of an __unnamed class__ in the __object payload parameter__.<br>
At the same way you can describe __variable values__ using the LogDebug overload with the __object payload parameter__.
also the __return value of a method scope__ can be tracked by means of the `scope.Result` value:

The following image shows a method scope where parameters and variabes are tracked with the __object payload parameter__ and the return value is tracked with the `scope.Result` value
![alt text](/images/v2/01.8%20write%20parameters,%20variables%20and%20method%20result.jpg "Trace output").

The following image shows trace output of such traces:
![alt text](/images/v2/01.9%20write%20parameters,%20variables%20and%20method%20result%20-%20output.jpg "Trace output").

## Configure Trace Providers
__Common.Diagnostics__ relies on standard tracing for .net so you can use the standard __.net Logging configuration section__.

The following image shows an example configuration section that specifies different trace levels for Log4Net and ApplicationInsight providers:

![alt text](/images/v2/01.10%20providers%20configuration.jpg "Trace output").

We mentioned that the application flow is obtained with a `TraceLoggerFormatProvider` with the real provider nested into it as an __inner provider__.<br>
Aliases are defined for `TraceLoggerFormatProvider` to allow provider specific configuration of the trace level.<br>
In the picture above we are using  `DiginsightFormattedLog4Net` to configure tracelevel when using Log4Net inner provider and `DiginsightFormattedApplicationInsights` to configure tracelevel when using ApplicationInsight inner provider.

In particular, in the shown example, `Debug` level is specified for __Log4Net__ and `Information` level is specified for __ApplicationInsight__.

__Additional configuration__ is available __at provider level__, to specify the exact information that should be rendered with the execution flow.
As an example it is possible to enable/disable rendering of the nesting level and the exact pieces of inforation that should be formatted into every trace line.

The following example specifies that the console provider used by a __blazor webassembly application__ should render the application flow without the trace source (the assembly name) to save space on the console window.<br>
![alt text](/images/v2/01.11%20providers%20configuration%20-%20additional.jpg "Trace output")<br>
On the other side, source information (and probably process and machine name, ip address etc) may be useful when sending telemetry to a central store such as __Application Insight__.   


The table below shows the configuration values that are availabe, __at provider level__:

| configuration value   | description           |
|-----------------------|:----------------------|
| TimestampFormat |(def."HH:mm:ss.fff") specifies the timestamp format for every trace entry|
| FlushOnWrite |(def. false) if true, a flush is performed at every write |
| ShowNestedFlow |(def. false) if true, spaced are used to show call nesting on the application flow |
| TraceMessageFormat |Format for standard trace messages <br>(def. '[{now}] {source} {category} {tidpid} - {logLevel} - {lastLineDeltaPadded} {deltaPadded} {nesting} {messageNesting}{message}') |
| TraceMessageFormatStart |Format scope start messages <br>(def. '[{now}] {source} {category} {tidpid} - {logLevel} - {lastLineDeltaPadded} {deltaPadded} {nesting} {messageNesting}{message}') |
| TraceMessageFormatStop |Format scope stop messages <br>(def. '[{now}] {source} {category} {tidpid} - {logLevel} - {lastLineDeltaPadded} {deltaPadded} {nesting} {messageNesting}{message}{result}') |
---------------

format strings can use the following placeholders:
| placeholder   | description           |
|-----------------------|:----------------------|
| Now	| The traceentry timestamp
| processName	| The processname
| source	| The trace entry source (eg. the source assembly)
| category	| The trace entry category (eg. the source class)
| tidpid	| Thread id and process id
| sourceLevel	| Source level
| logLevel	| Log level
| nesting	| Nesting level (as a number)
| messageNesting	| Message Nesting as spaces
| message	| The trace entry real message
| lastLineDelta	| Time delta since last trace line
| lastLineDeltaPadded	| Time delta since last trace line (with padding)
| delta	| Time delta scope start (method start)
| deltaPadded	| Time delta scope start (with patting)
| result	| Result (only for TraceMessageFormatStop)
